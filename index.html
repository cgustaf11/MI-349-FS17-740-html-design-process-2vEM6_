      <h4>Short Pitch:</h4>
      <p>Outer State Enterprises is a Space Launch specialist that entered the market in 2017 to bring affordable, reliable launches to everyone.</p>

      <h4>Long Pitch:</h4>
      <p>You want to go to space, and we want to take you there. Competition in this market has been lacking for the past several thousand years, and Outer State Enterprises
         is here to help change that. Aside from providing citzens, corporations, and governments with lift and transportation capabilities, Outer State is also interested in
         colonizing and exploiting the world outside of Earth. Be a part of Outer State, and invest in the end of the Universe. </p>

      <h4>Personas:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Governments:</strong> NASA, for example, is looking to cut costs and keep up with the demands of future research. We can help them accomplish their goals at
          a fraction of the costs due to our Universal explotation.</li>
        <li><strong>Corportations:</strong> Resources on Earth are finite, and the ability to expand the playing ground into the outer world is an opportunity that corporations
          cannot afford to ignore. We provide businesses of all sizes with the ability to expand their horizons, in the most literal sense possible.</li>
        <li><strong>You:</strong> Yes, you, the evil businessmen, or the Middle Class family looking for an Out of This World vacation. Whether you're looking to exploit the Universe
          with us, or just to find a reason to avoid Florida, we're here for you. For those looking to help us destroy the Universe, get ahold of Rick. For those looking for something
          different on their next vacation, contact Denise.</li>
      </ul>
